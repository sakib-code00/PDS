file, etc.) by typing commands rather than clicking icons and menus.\n","Note that with just a few commands (``pwd``, ``ls``, ``cd``, ``mkdir``, and ``cp``) you can do many of the most common file

this without the ``%`` sign:\n","\n","```ipython\n","In [15]: cd myproject\n","/home/jake/projects/myproject\n","```\n","\n","This is known as an ``automagic`` function, and this behavior can be toggled with the ``%automagic`` magic function.\n","\n","Besides ``%cd``, other available shell-like magic functions are ``%cat``, ``%cp``, ``%env``, ``%ls``, ``%man``, ``%mkdir``, ``%more``, ``%mv``, ``%pwd``, ``%rm``, and ``%rmdir``, any of which can be used without the ``%`` sign if ``automagic`` is on.\n","This makes it so that you can almost treat the IPython prompt as if it's a normal
